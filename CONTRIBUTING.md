## Replacing the hero images

Images used in the hero section can be rotated periodically, using images from public domain productions.

In order to generate a suitable image:

- Make sure the image is at least in 1920Ã—1080. Some leeway is afforded for very old movies in 4:3.
- In Gimp, add an LCh Color layer and fill it with #35284D.
- Save the image as PNG, replacing one of the existing hero images.
